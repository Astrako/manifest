## Setup Galaxy A3 2017 for AOSP-Quack based rom

* Download supported sources (LineageOS, AOSCP, RR, etc...) (this source is suited best for LineageOS, you will have to modify it for other ROMs)
* Once this is download, clone this repo to .repo/local_manifests then sync repositories again
* Do the command . build/env*
* Launch your build (brunch aosp_a3y17lte-userdebug, aosp can change depending on the target rom)
